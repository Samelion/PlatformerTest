# PlatformerTest

A prototype 2D platforming character controller. 
You can play around in the small example scene [Here](https://samson.itch.io/platformer-test).

Includes:
- Slopes and sliding.
- Wall jumps and wall sliding.
- Variable jump height.
- Buffered inputs (for scenarios where jump is pressed just before landing).
- Coyote time (allows you to jump briefly after walking off an edge).
- Wall Magnetism (makes wall jumping/sliding more reliable).
